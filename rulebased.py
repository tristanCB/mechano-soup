Simple Function which extracts data for covid clinics:
This pipeline must be able to:
    - Extract all clinics listed in the Tables on the Montreal Health website
    - Extract their "name", "address", "phone" (if available), "opening_hours" (as text)
    and if they require an appointment or not ("appointment_required").
    - Clean any special characters or HTML from dataset
    - Each clinic must only appear once (No duplicates)
    - You can add more fields if you find any pertinent information
    - Save a JSON file containing all the clinics as "covid_clinics.json"
